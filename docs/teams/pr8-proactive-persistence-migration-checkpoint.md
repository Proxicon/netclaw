# PR 8 proactive-persistence migration checkpoint

## Purpose and status

This is a checkpoint for the PR 8 proactive-reminder architecture correction.
The architecture correction is in progress. Live validation has not started.

- Branch: `feature/teams-channel-pr8-proactive-reminders`
- Pre-checkpoint head: `4baf137c`
- Safety reference: `backup/teams-pr8-before-quality-review`

## Why the rework was required

Teams persistence had leaked into generic Actors. A direct move would make
existing journals and snapshots unreadable. The prior design also had a
permanent-invalidation crash gap, no destination generation, one mutable
delivery correlation, no known-destination resolver, non-authoritative
diagnostics, and no request-context disposal proof.

## Implemented architecture

New Teams records, snapshots, protobuf schema, and serializer are Teams-owned.
The generic serializer reads legacy Teams manifests into a decode-only envelope;
the Teams recovery actors convert that envelope and write only v2 snapshots.
Destination generation is retained per delivery. A permanent delivery failure
records its terminal state and matching-generation invalidation in one v2 event.
Session output carries immutable per-delivery correlation. The daemon no longer
caches an SDK request context. The binding actor resolves its own current or
explicit canonical destination. It fails closed for unavailable and
cross-session destinations. Actor-owned diagnostics expose safe bounded state.

## Responsibility map

- Generic compatibility: `Netclaw.Actors` legacy envelope, legacy protobuf
  definitions, and decode-only manifests.
- Teams active state: `Netclaw.Channels.Teams` persistence contracts, serializer,
  recovery conversion, binding state, channel index, and resolver.
- Daemon boundary: Teams SDK send uses the app-level sender only.
- Tests: Actors serialization and Teams routing/persistence coverage.

## Legacy migration table

| Legacy manifest/type | Legacy payload shape | Decode owner | Teams v2 write path | Conversion and trigger | Unsupported/lossy behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tapc-v1`, `tacd-v1`, `taco-v1` | approval pending, card locator, terminal decision | generic `LegacyChannelPersistenceEnvelope`; binding actor | approval v2 records and `teams-binding-snapshot-v2` | `ApplyLegacyPersistence`; recovery completion saves a v2 snapshot | invalid approval values fail recovery |
| `tpdc-v1`, `tpdi-v1`, `tpdr-v1` | destination capture, invalidation, delivery state | generic envelope; binding actor | destination/delivery v2 records and binding snapshot | `ApplyLegacyDestination` and `ApplyProactiveDeliveryRecorded`; recovery completion saves v2 | no destination values are invented; invalid or mismatched destinations fail recovery |
| `dads-v1` with Teams fields | activity fingerprints, approvals, destination, deliveries | generic envelope; binding actor | `teams-binding-snapshot-v2` | `ApplyLegacySnapshot`; recovery completion saves v2 | a payload without Teams fields remains the generic activity snapshot; invalid Teams fields fail recovery |
| `dtcam-v1`, `dtcais-v1` | channel activity map or index entries | generic envelope; channel conversation actor | channel map/snapshot v2 | `ApplyLegacyPersistence`; recovery completion saves v2 | invalid fingerprints or canonical channel sessions fail recovery |

## Migration and restart proof

The deterministic migration matrix is complete in
`TeamsPersonalRoutingTests`. It builds historical protobuf payloads with the
real legacy manifests, decodes them through `NetclawProtobufSerializer`, and
seeds the persistence test journal or snapshot store at explicit sequence
numbers. No fixture constructs a pre-converted v2 record.

- Journal-only legacy state recovers approval, destination, delivery, and
  routing state; the generated binding snapshot is `TeamsBindingSnapshot` v1;
  a restart suppresses the already routed activity.
- Legacy snapshot only, snapshot plus later legacy events, and legacy plus
  later v2 events all recover in order, compact to a Teams-owned v2 snapshot,
  and restart from that snapshot.
- Legacy channel index records compact to `TeamsChannelActivityIndexSnapshot`
  and survive restart.
- Forced migration snapshot failures leave binding migration health `Failed`.
  Repeated restarts retry from retained legacy journal records without state
  multiplication. A later successful save retains even a sequence-1 snapshot;
  compaction now deletes older snapshots only when one exists.
- Empty or insufficient legacy destination/snapshot payloads remain
  decode-only envelopes and cannot be emitted by the generic serializer. New
  Teams events and snapshots resolve only to serializer 151 v2 manifests.

## Current local validation

- Focused Teams routing/persistence tests: 41 passed, including the legacy
  migration and restart matrix.
- The fresh Daemon.Tests build passed with zero warnings and errors.
- `dotnet slopwatch analyze`: 0 issues.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

## Known incomplete gates

- End-to-end request-context disposal proof.
- Crash, concurrency, retention, and broader snapshot-compaction matrices.
- Full channel/reminder regressions and the architecture audit.
- Push CI and dedicated personal/channel/negative live validation.

## Resume order

1. Read this checkpoint and inspect the branch diff.
2. Do not redesign or repeat completed migration work.
3. Complete the request-context disposal proof.
4. Complete crash, concurrency, retention, and broader snapshot matrices.
5. Run full regressions and the architecture audit.
6. Push corrections and wait for CI.
7. Run dedicated live proactive validation only after the architecture gate passes.

## Prohibited shortcuts

- Do not relocate serializers without legacy decoding.
- Do not write legacy manifests or add Teams persistence to generic Actors.
- Do not alter persisted test state to force recovery or add a test-only reminder
  endpoint.
- Do not perform live validation before the architecture gate passes.
